## Overview

Fast Volleyball Tracking Inference provides a solution for real-time volleyball ball detection and tracking. This tool operates at an impressive 200 frames per second (FPS) on a standard CPU (Intel i5-10400F). It leverages an optimized ONNX model to deliver precise ball coordinates, which can be exported to CSV files. Additionally, users can visualize the tracking on video feeds, making it an excellent resource for sports analytics and computer vision research.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Achieve ball detection and tracking at 200 FPS.
- **ONNX Model**: Utilizes an optimized ONNX model for enhanced performance.
- **CSV Output**: Exports ball coordinates to CSV for easy analysis.
- **Video Visualization**: Offers optional visualization of tracking on video.
- **CPU Optimization**: Designed to run efficiently on common CPU hardware.
- **Versatile Applications**: Ideal for sports analytics, machine learning, and computer vision projects.

## Installation

To get started with Fast Volleyball Tracking Inference, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/csds21/fast-volleyball-tracking-inference.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd fast-volleyball-tracking-inference
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Use pip to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Model**:
   You can download the optimized ONNX model from the [Releases section](https://github.com/csds21/fast-volleyball-tracking-inference/releases). Follow the instructions provided there to set it up.

## Usage

To run the Fast Volleyball Tracking Inference tool, use the following command:

```bash
python track_volleyball.py --input <video_file> --output <output_file.csv>
```

- **--input**: Specify the path to the video file you want to analyze.
- **--output**: Specify the path where you want to save the CSV output.

### Example

```bash
python track_volleyball.py --input match_video.mp4 --output tracking_data.csv
```

This command will process the video `match_video.mp4` and save the tracking data to `tracking_data.csv`.

### Optional Video Visualization

If you want to visualize the tracking on the video, you can add the `--visualize` flag:

```bash
python track_volleyball.py --input match_video.mp4 --output tracking_data.csv --visualize
```

This will display the video with tracking overlays in real-time.

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

The core of this application is based on the TrackNet architecture. It has been optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications. The model processes video frames, identifies the volleyball, and tracks its movement.

### Performance Metrics

- **Detection Speed**: 200 FPS on Intel i5-10400F.
- **Accuracy**: High precision in ball detection, validated through extensive testing.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- ONNX Runtime
